    "### What does a factory signify?\n",
    "A factory is a design pattern that outlines an interface for the creation of objects in a superclass, granting subclasses the flexibility to modify the kind of objects that are to be created.<br>Within the scope of this scenario, a factory known as 'HsmrParserFactory' is instantiated, the function of which is to yield an instance of the parser. It takes as an argument the type of parser (either HSMR_REPORT_PDF or HSMR_REPORT_TEXT from parserTypes.py), and returns an instance of the relevant parser. The factory aids in abstracting the creation process of objects and enables the program to dynamically decide the type of Parser required based on the specific context's needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is the factory method implementation compliant with the Interface Segregation Principle?\n",
    "The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), which forms a part of the five SOLID principles for object-oriented programming and design, specifies that clients should not be compelled to depend on interfaces they do not utilize. Hence, extensive interfaces should be subdivided into smaller ones to ensure clients only need to know about the methods pertinent to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focusing on how clients interact with necessary services, the ISP finds relevance in the context of this scenario because clients invoke the method to create a parser without dealing with any other methods provided by the Factory class. Hence, the application of the Factory Method in this context conforms to the Interface Segregation Principle."

    "### Does the implementation of the factory method follow the Interface Segregation Principle?\n",
    "The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is one of the five principles of SOLID in object-oriented programming and design. It states that no client should be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This means that large interfaces should be split into smaller ones, so that clients will only have to know about the methods that are of interest to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ISP is mainly about clients and how they interact with the services they need. In this case because the clients are only invoking the method to create a parser, and they don't have to deal with any other methods that the Factory class provide, then this use of the Factory Method would conform to the Interface Segregation Principle."

    "\n",
    "Here are the characteristics that make `LocalSettings` a Singleton:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The class attribute `instance` is used to store the one and only instance of the class. It is initially set to `None`.\n",
    "2. The `__new__` method is overridden. This method is responsible for creating and returning a new object. In this case, it checks if an instance already exists. If not, it creates a new instance of the internal `__LocalSettings` class and assigns it to `LocalSettings.instance`. If an instance does exist, it simply returns the existing instance.\n",
    "3. The `__init__` method also checks if an instance already exists, and if not, it creates one. However, since `__new__` is always called before `__init__`, this check is somewhat redundant in this case. \n",

    "About the SOLID principles: \n",
    "\n",
    "The Singleton Pattern could potentially violate the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) if it's used for anything beyond ensuring there's only a single instance, because then it's doing more than one thing.\n",

By storing these values in a module, we can easily add more constants as the program expands (extension), without needing to modify the existing constants or the code that uses them (closed for modification)."

    "One alternative is using configuration files (like JSON, or YAML files) instead of storing settings directly in the code or modules. The application can read these files at runtime to get the required configuration values. This method allows for easy modification of settings without changing the code itself and provides flexibility in managing different settings for different environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method is through Command-Line Arguments. Rather than storing settings in a separate file or module, we can pass them as command-line arguments when the application is run. The application can parse these arguments and use them to configure its behavior. This approach provides flexibility and enables easy customization of settings during application startup.\n",
