# Advanced Programming Assignments:
## Master Data Science for Life Science (Hanze University)

This repository contains my work for the Advanced Programming course assignments. Each folder represents the work completed for a specific week. Here's a quick rundown of what each directory contains:

## Repository Structure

- `Week 1.2/` SOLID principles assignment
- `Week 1.2/`: Classes, objects, constructors, destructors, object lifecycle, and dunder methods.
- `Week 1.3/`:  Multiple class interaction and modules.
- `Week 1.4/`: List comprehensions, generators, and map-reduce.
- `Week 2.1/`: Network operations and the POSIX stack.
- `Week 2.2/`: Parallel computing.
- `Week 2.3/`: Classification with dask_ml.
- `Week 2.4/`: Need more revision.
- `Week 2.5/`: Slurm and Dask.
- `Week 2.6/`: MLOps.
- `Week 2.7/`: Software Engineering for Machine Learning.


## Dependencies
The Python libraries used in these assignments are:

urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error
BeautifulSoup (bs4)
ssl
re
json
linecache
time
http.server
socketserver
pandas
asyncio
aiohttp
Bio (Entrez)
multiprocessing
os
dask.dataframe, dask.distributed
sklearn (SVC, datasets, model_selection, linear_model, ensemble, preprocessing)
joblib
numpy
matplotlib.pyplot
logging
watchdog (observers, events)

## Environment Setup
To set up the environment and install the necessary libraries, follow these steps:

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended). You can use virtualenv or conda to create a virtual environment.

Activate the virtual environment.

Install the required Python libraries using the requirements.txt file with pip:
!pip install -r requirements.txt


## Installation and Usage
To install the necessary dependencies for these assignments, you can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your command line. All scripts can be run from the command line using the `python script_name.py` command.


## Contributions
These assignments are part of a personal academic course and as such, I'm not accepting contributions.
You're welcome to fork and use the repository for your personal use.
