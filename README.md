# Advanced Programming Assignments:
## Master Data Science for Life Science (Hanze University)

The assignments here cover a range of topics from object-oriented programming to parallel and distributed computing.

## Repository Structure
- `Week 1.2/`: Classes, objects, constructors, destructors, object lifecycle, and dunder methods.
- `Week 1.3/`:  Multiple class interaction and modules.
- `Week 1.4/`: List comprehensions, generators, and map-reduce.
- 
- `Week 2.1/`: Network operations and the POSIX stack.
- `Week 2.2/`: Parallel computing.
- `Week 2.3/`: Classification with dask_ml.
- `Week 2.4/`: Need more revision.
- 'Week 2.5/': Slurm and Dask.
- `Week 2.6/`: MLOps.
- `Week 2.7/`: Software Engineering for Machine Learning.

## Running the Code

All code is written in Python. Ensure you have Python 3 installed, and it's recommended to use a virtual environment.
To install necessary dependencies, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Assignments

Each assignment is located in its respective folder.
Inside, you will find the Python script(s) for the assignment,
along with a file detailing the purpose of the assignment, the problem it solves, and any other important details.


## Installation & Usage

To install and run these assignments on your local machine, please follow these steps:

Clone this repository. Ensure that you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. If not, you can install Python via Anaconda which includes Jupyter Notebook.

Contributing If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and make changes as you'd like. Pull requests are warmly welcome.

## Installation and Usage

To install the necessary dependencies for these assignments, you can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your command line. All scripts can be run from the command line using the `python script_name.py` command.

## Testing

For most assignments, example test cases are included.
After running a script, you can verify its correctness by comparing its output to the expected output described in the test case.
